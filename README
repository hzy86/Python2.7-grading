There are programs that automate the some process of grading Canvas submissions to save my time.

grading.py

  In the folder "submissions" where all the submission are downloaded via SpeedGrader and unzipped, run this program to
  automatically unzipping files that satisfy format requirements.

  In this class, it's requried that:
    - submit a file name "hw3.zip"
    - unzipping this file gives a folder "hw3" that contains all .py files

  The filename format of Canvas submissions looks like "name_late(if late)_id_id_HW3.zip"

  This program unzips files that satisfy the requirements and pause after unzipping finishes to wait for grading.
  When grading is finished, press "Enter" to continue unzipping the next file.

first_round.py tournament.py

  Using Google sheets APIs with gspread to generate random player pairs to compete in the AI Mancala tournament.
  Credentials are stored on local machine and are not revealed here. You have to set up your own google api credentials in order to
  try out this program.
  Change the name of the worksheet to whatever you want to modify, but be sure to allow your google client to modify that worksheet.

  first_round.py parses names from the files in "submissions", generates random pairs, and put them to the google sheet.
  It prints the left-out player on the console if the total number of players is odd.

  tournament.py takes the names of the winners from the google sheet, generates random pairs,
  and extracts the winners' files from the "submissiosn" folder. playerA's file is put into the "tournament" folder,
  and playerB's is put into the "tournament_B" folder, both will be created in the working directory.

  tournament.py waits for the matches to be completed and deletes the players' files after you enter "Enter" to continue.

  Extracted files are name "ai.py" and are put in "hw3" folders due to the submission requirements.
